# Arcan-Devices

This repository carries support scripts and tools for extending arcan
with support for various input and output devices. Most / many of these
devices may require additional support from the window manager itself,
or some hook- script or other configuration to be actually useable.

See the individual directories for additional README.mds and other
instructions in such cases.

The repository currently contains:

*streamdeck/* adds support for ElGato Stream Deck like devices, which
are a grid of buttons laid on top of a low resolution screen.
